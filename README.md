Cluster the data you artificially generated using the DBscan algorithm from scikit-learn.

The code does the following steps:


1 – Generate sample points from 4 artificially generated clusters and save the points in a .npy file. 

2 – Plot the 4 clusters in a single figure.

3 – Cluster the data that artificially has generated using the DBscan algorithm from scikit-learn.

4 – Apply DBscan over the data provided with the test.
